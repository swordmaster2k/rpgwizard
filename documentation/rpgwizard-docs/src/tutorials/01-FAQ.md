# What platforms does RPGWizard support?
At the moment the RPGWizard editor officially supports:
* Windows Desktops
* Linux Desktops

It may be possible to run it on OSX with Java 8+ using the Linux distribution, but this has yet to be tested.

The game engine can be run inside any modern desktop or mobile browser, with the best support for Chrome/Chromium like browsers.

# Can I make a game without programming?
Not really, at least not anything original. While some things can be achieved without programming your game will likely feel like a copy & paste experience. Fortunately programming in RPGWizard isn't all that hard, and there are plenty of examples!

# What programming language does RPGWizard use?
[JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) is the scripting language you'll use to write your game logic, the RPGWizard engine is built upon a recent version of Chromium that supports the latest [ES6 Standard](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp).

# Can I make a MMORPG/Online RPG?
Yes, however you would need to be already very confident with programming and networking, as RPGWizard doesn't provide a multiplayer server, so you'll either need to write your own or use something like [Colyseus](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus). Either way you'll need to write both a network client for your RPGWizard game, and the server side logic.

# Can I make a Platformer/Shooter/Puzzle/Non-RPG game with RPGWizard?
Technically yes, other types of games are possible and some people have already created some. However the engine is best suited to 2D RPG style games.

# How do I play my game on Android/iOS?
It is possible using mobile browsers, but it hasn't been fully documented yet.

# How do I play my game on Switch/Xbox/PS4?
This is not currently possible, as it would likely require access to dedicated dev kits of each console for testing.

# Can I sell my game commercially?
Yes, as long as you own the game's assets or otherwise have permission to use them. The RPGWizard itself is licensed in a commercially friendly way, however we wouldn't consider it stable enough yet for anything beyond hobbyist or educational uses.

# How do I contribute to RPGWizard?
